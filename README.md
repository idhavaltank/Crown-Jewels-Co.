## üèóÔ∏è Solution Architecture

### Modular Organization

```
/app          # Pages: login, product list/detail, cart, checkout, profile
/components   # UI primitives: Card, FormInput, Toast, Buttons, etc.
/Redux        # All Redux slices: user, products, productDetail, cart
/graphql      # Apollo Client setup, queries & mutations
/styles       # Tailwind configuration & theming
/contexts     # React Contexts for Auth and Cart state
/services     # API services and GraphQL hooks
/utils        # Utility functions and helpers
```

### Data and State Flow

- **User/Auth & Cart State:**  
  Synchronized with Redux Toolkit, hydrated from localStorage on app load for seamless session continuity. All sensitive actions guarded with appropriate authentication checks.

- **Data Fetching:**  
  Product data is fetched server-side for all commerce-critical pages for optimal performance and SEO benefits. Mutations (login, order creation) use isolated, reusable GraphQL hooks.

## üß© Implemented Functionality

|           Page           | Features                                                                                                        |
| :----------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|        **Login**         | Secure login via Redux + persisted token, inline validation, toast feedback                                     |
|  **Product List (PLP)**  | Server-side rendered product grid, error/empty states, ready for filters & pagination                           |
| **Product Detail (PDP)** | Variant selectors, add-to-cart UX, image gallery, pricing & availability info                                   |
|         **Cart**         | Redux-driven cart with quantity updates, removal, subtotal calculations, and persistence                        |
|       **Checkout**       | Multi-field shipping/payment form with client-side validation, GraphQL order mutation, success/failure handling |

> All pages are fully responsive and accessibility-audited, ensuring a seamless UX across devices and users.

## üí° Senior Engineering Decisions

- **Redux Toolkit for All Persistent State:**  
  Guarantees debuggability, testability, and future scalability in user session and cart state persistence.

- **Apollo Client with Modular Hooks:**  
  Isolates GraphQL logic for minimal coupling between UI and data layer.

- **Balanced SSR & CSR Usage:**  
  Server-side rendering for SEO-critical pages, combined with client-side interactions for responsiveness and UX polish.

- **Atomic, Context-Driven Components:**  
  Enhances maintainability and allows isolated testing and extensibility.

- **Consistent & Overridable UI Components:**  
  Developed atop Tailwind CSS for rapid theming and design adjustments.
